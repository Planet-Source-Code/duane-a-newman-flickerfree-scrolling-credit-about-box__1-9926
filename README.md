## Flickerfree Scrolling Credit About box


</div>

### Description

An about/splash box that has a flicker-free Credit scroll. Uses only the form and one Picturebox; bitblt's the pb image into the client area of the form and uses InvalidateRect to force a redraw of only the area affected. Has methods to read data in from a .RES or a text file. Vote for me if you like what I've done with this, but take a look at Mark's original and let him know he did a great job too!

This code uses the basic idea of Mark Robert Strange's 'Flicker Free Gradient Credits' and applies a great deal of modifications to use less resources and have more features.
 
### More Info
 
You can pretty much just throw this form in and modify your app's RES file or include the credits.txt file in your app path.

None known.
